          <h2>Customer Feedback</h2>
          <p>Florica is a non-stop high energy realtor that really took care of us and made sure we saw all the houses we needed to gain a total picture and perspective. She was patient and answered all our questions and gave us good advice in negotiating. On top of all that she even gave us a good lead for a very good moving company and also an excellent cleaning lady as well as someone to do 'house check' when we are away. Total professional and one stop shop experience. ! - Lawrence</p>
